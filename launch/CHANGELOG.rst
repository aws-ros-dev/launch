Changelog for package launch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.5.0 (2018-06-19)
------------------
* Fixed a bug where unclosed asyncio loops caused a traceback on the terminal on exit, but only in Python 3.5 (`#85 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/85>`_)
* Changed to use variable typing in comments to support python 3.5 (`#81 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/81>`_)
* New launch API (`#74 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/74>`_)
  * See pull request for more details and links to architecture documentation and the design doc.
* Moved launch source files into launch.legacy namespace (`#73 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/73>`_)
  * This was in preparation for the new launch API.
* [for launch.legacy] fixed a flake8 warning (`#72 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/72>`_)
* [for launch.legacy] set zip_safe to avoid warning during installation (`#71 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/71>`_)
* [for launch.legacy] Fix hang on keyboard interrupt (`#69 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/69>`_)
  * When keyboard interrupt exception occurs loop.run_forever is called. But there is no loop.stop call. This causes a hang.
